# journald configuration for ChatbotGate
#
# This file configures systemd's journal daemon to manage ChatbotGate logs.
# Place this in /etc/systemd/journald.conf or create a drop-in file in
# /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/

# After editing, restart journald:
#   sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
#
# Note: These settings affect ALL services using journald, not just ChatbotGate.
# For service-specific settings, use systemd service overrides.
